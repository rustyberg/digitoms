This is a Processing 2.0 implementation of the Digitom family tool.

To install:

1) Extract the files into a folder called "digitoms"
2) Move the folder to your processing sketch folded.
3) In Processing, choose "open" and select digitoms.
4) Click the run button.


Usage:

The left and right arrow keys move you between families. To the left are
are pre-defined families, to the right are new, random families. If you
modify a pre-defined family a new, duplicate family will be created which
you can choose to save or discard.

The keyboard commands are listed on the right panel along with the current
values for each parameter. The 'm' command cycles through the modes (really
layers) and allows changes to a particular layer. In 'All" mode changes are
applied to all layers.

When you capture ('c' or 'C' command to create a .png or .pdf file) or save a family the file will be saved in the folder Documents/DigiData.

Have fun!
